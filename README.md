Documentation
-------------
* [Installation](https://github.com/selenium-cucumber/selenium-cucumber-java/blob/master/doc/installation.md)
* [Predefined steps](https://github.com/selenium-cucumber/selenium-cucumber-java/blob/master/doc/canned_steps.md)

Accessibility
-------------

A step for checking the accessibility of the current page has been added. In order to use, add an appropriate 
`Then` step:

```code 
Then Check Accessibility: max X violations
```

Where **X** is the maximum number of violations that will not fail the build.

Currently [axe 2](https://axe-core.org/) is being used as the accessibility check engine.

-------

* Run with parameters specifying a browser and a webdriver's path

Example:
```bash
# for Firefox
mvn clean test -Dbrowser=firefox -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/home/user/geckodriver
# for Chrome
